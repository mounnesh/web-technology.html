<h1>History of Web Technology</h1>
<p>
<h2>Back in the 1960s, the United States Department of Defense made a thing called ARPANET. It helped organizations share information. Then in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, who worked with computers at CERN, had an idea. He wanted to make a system of hypertext documents that people could access online. This idea became the World Wide Web.
    Berners-Lee made the first web browser in 1991. It was called World Wide Web. This led to the first web server. In the mid-1990s, people started using web browsers a lot more. This was because they became more user-friendly. The first commercial web browsers, like Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, helped make this happen.
    In the late 1990s, things became even more interactive. This was thanks to new web technologies like PHP, ASP.NET and JavaScript. They allowed people to use the web for online shopping and gaming.
    In the early 2000s, web pages became more accessible and user-friendly. This was because of things like HTML and CSS. They helped make sure that web pages looked the same on different devices.
    Then in the late 2000s and 2010s, the web changed again. Social media, mobile devices, and cloud computing are big web parts. This meant that people could collaborate more and make things together.
    Today, the web is still changing. New artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and the Internet of Things exist. These things mean that people can do even more on the web.
